# House-listings
the initial idea was to learn PHP Laravel since that the language and framework that was being used in Judiciary of kenya. I ended up creating a whole project name (Sakakeja).
SakaKeja is sheng word which loosely translates to 'Look for a house'. 
so this Website is generally for searching for availlable house listings to help Busy Nairobians look for Houses without the need of leaving their confort zone.
Framework Used Laravel
languages PHP, and some Javascript.
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, alpinejs (especially for the flash messages), tailwind CSS.
